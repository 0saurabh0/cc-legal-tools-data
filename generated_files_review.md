# Generated Files Review


## Overview

There are almost 30,000 files in `docs/` (29,790 as of 2022-01-06). This means
that a comprehensive review of all files changed in a pull request is often
unfeasible (both because of the time required and GitHub's inability to deal
with pull requests with that many files). The instructions below provide a way
to spot check large pull requests by using Docker and emblematic files.

See the [`README.md`](README.md) for additional information on this repository,
the CC Legal Tools namespace, and definitions of terms.


## Review Changes Locally

- The GitHub CLI makes interacting with pull requests locally much easier:
  - [Manual | GitHub CLI][ghcli-manual]
  - [gh pr | Manual | GitHub CLI][ghcli-pr] - Work with GitHub pull requests.
- [Checking out pull requests locally - GitHub Docs][prs-locally] describes how
  to use `git` to checkout a pull request locally

### Emblematic Files

### Docker Compose Setup

You can use Docker to locally view the files of a specific branch or pull
request. Note that CC Staff do not use Windows for development and additional
steps may be required on that platform.

1. Install Docker
   - ([Install Docker Engine | Docker Documentation][installdockerlinux]) for
     Linux
   - ([Install Docker Engine | Docker Documentation][installdockermacOS]) for
     macOS
   - ([Install Docker Engine | Docker Documentation][installdockerwindows]) for
     Windows
3. Ensure you are the top level of directory of this repository (where the
   `docker-compose.yml` file is)
4. Build the containers
    ```shell
    docker compose build
    ```
5. **Run the containers**
    ```shell
    docker compose up
    ```
   - **static** ([127.0.0.1:8007](http://127.0.0.1:8007/)): a static web
     server serving the `docs/` directory
