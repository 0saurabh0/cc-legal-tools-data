          <li>
           1.1.

            "Adaptation"
           </strong>
           means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, derivative work, arrangement of music, conversion of a non-dramatic literary work into a dramatic work and

           </em>
           , or other alterations of a work. It includes any form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognisably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence. Where the Work is a musical work, performance or sound recording, the synchronisation of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence.
          </li>
          <li>
           1.2.

The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works. "Non-Commercial" has a corresponding meaning.

           4. Restrictions
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          The Licence granted in Clause 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           4.1.
           <i>
            Works
           </i>
          </li>
          <li>
           <ul>
            <li>
             4.1.1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.1.2. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.1.3. You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this Licence or the ability of recipients of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to them under the terms of the Licence.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.1.4. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.1.5. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of recipients of the Work to exercise the rights granted to them under the terms of the Licence or as permitted by law as specified in Clause 2.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.1.6. You may not sublicense the Work. Instead, the rights provided under this Licence are granted directly to the recipients of the Work by Clause 8.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.1.7. While this Clause 4.1. (including sub-clauses 4.1.1. - 4.1.6.) also applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection, it does not require other works within the Collection, or the Collection as a whole, to be made subject to the terms of this Licence.
            </li>
           </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
           <ul>
            <li>
             4.2.1. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Clause 4.2.4., keep intact all copyright notices for the Work.
            </li>
            <li>
             4.2.2. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Clause 4.2.4., provide, in a manner reasonable to the medium or means You are using:
            </li>
            <ul>
             <li>
              4.2.2.1. the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym if provided) if supplied, and/or any other party ("Attribution Parties") that the Original Author or Licensor has, e.g. in the copyright notice or terms of use, requested to be attributed (such as a sponsor institute, publishing Entity or journal);
             </li>
             <li>
              4.2.2.2. the title of the Work if provided;
             </li>
             <li>
              4.2.2.3. to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier (e.g., a web link) that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such Uniform Resource Identifier  does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and
             </li>
             <li>
              4.2.2.4. in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "Xhosa translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
             </li>
            </ul>
           </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
           4.2.3. In the case of an Adaptation or Collection the attribution must, at a minimum, appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
          </li>
          <li>
           4.2.4. You must, upon request from any Licensor or Original Author and to the extent practicable, remove the above attribution from any Collection or Adaptation You create.
          </li>
          <li>

           Commercial use
          </i>

           Voluntary Licence Schemes
          </i>
          <p>
           The Licensor reserves the right to collect royalties (whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes (e.g., DALRO, NORM, SAMRO or SARRAL), via that society) for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or use which is otherwise than Non-Commercial.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>

           In the case of a compulsory or statutory licence being granted in relation to the Work:
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <ul>
           <li>
            4.5.1. If the right to collect royalties under such compulsory or statutory licence cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
           </li>
           <li>
            4.5.2. If the right to collect royalties under such compulsory or statutory licence can be waived, the Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, but only if Your exercise of rights granted under this Licence is for a Non-Commercial purpose or use.
           </li>
          </ul>
         </li>
         <li>

           5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK "AS IS" (
          <em>
           VOETSTOOTS
          </em>
          ) AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS TO ACCURACY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           6.  Limitation on Liability
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT THE LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENCE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, ON ANY BASIS WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CONTRACT, DELICT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT OR STATUTORY CLAIMS), EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           7. Termination
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           7.1. This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence. Individuals or Entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this Licence, however, will not have their licences terminated provided such individuals or Entities remain in full compliance with those licences.
          </li>
          <li>
           7.2. Clauses 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 will survive any termination of this Licence.
          </li>
          <li>
           7.3. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the Licence granted here is for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work. Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other Licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          <strong>
           8. Licence Grant to Recipients of the Work, Adaptation or Collection from You
          </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
          Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, an Adaptation or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a Licence to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the Licence granted to You under this Licence.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           9. Miscellaneous
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           9.1. If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
          </li>
          <li>
           9.2. No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
          </li>
          <li>
           9.3. This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. No understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not contained in this Licence shall form part of this Licence. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
