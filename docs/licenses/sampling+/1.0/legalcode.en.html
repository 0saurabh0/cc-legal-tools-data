not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
and in the
case of a Derivative Work, provide a credit identifying the use of the
Work in
the Derivative Work (e.g., "Remix of the Work by Original Author," or
"Inclusion of a portion of the Work by Original Author in collage").
Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a
minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship
credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other
comparable authorship credit.

Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from

notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from
the Derivative Work or Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
the Original Author, as requested.
