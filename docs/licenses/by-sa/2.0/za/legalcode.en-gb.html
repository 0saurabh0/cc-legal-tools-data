You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement or as permitted by law as specified in Section 2. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

            You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available a Derivative Work only under the terms of this Licence, a later version of this Licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence, or a Creative Commons iCommons Licence that contains the same Licence Elements as this Licence (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Japan). You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence or other Licence specified in the previous sentence with every copy of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish and make available.

You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available the Derivative Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement or as permitted by law as specified in Section 2. The above applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence.
           </li>
           <li>
            If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, broadcast, transmit, publish or make available the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all rights management information for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means that You are utilizing by:
